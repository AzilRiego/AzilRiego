        An <b>Aspiring Author</b> often lost in her imagination and is always sleepy. <br>
      Amidst the flurry of my writing journey, I found myself veering off course, wandering into a storm I had never anticipated. It wasn’t a storm of winds or rain, but one of uncertainty—a tempest that tested my resolve and threatened to swallow my sense of direction. <br>
      Yet, from that chaos emerged something unexpected. The storm swept me onto a new and unfamiliar path, one I had never considered before: coding. At first, it felt foreign and daunting, the terrain rugged with challenges I struggled to overcome. The language of this new world was strange, its rules intricate, its logic a puzzle I wasn’t sure I could unravel. <br>
      But there was something captivating about it. Despite the difficulties, I couldn’t ignore the spark of curiosity ignited within me. With each small step forward, I felt the weight of fear lifting, replaced by a quiet determination. The path ahead was unclear, its twists and turns obscured by the shadows of my inexperience. <br>
      And yet, I pressed on. The storm may have altered my course, but it hadn’t extinguished my drive to discover what lay ahead. The world of coding stretched before me like an uncharted map, and I was ready to navigate its mysteries, one step at a time. <br>
